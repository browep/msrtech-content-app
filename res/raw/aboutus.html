With a life-long interest in sewing, Laurel Barrus, founder of Handi Quilter, had the idea
for the “Handi Quilter” portable frame when she was looking for a way to take a portable
machine quilting frame to her family cabin. She could not find anything to suit her needs in the
marketplace, so she worked with her father to create something that could be used with her own
home sewing machine. It had to be light and small enough to carry in her car yet adjustable so
it could car, accommodate small or large quilts. When her friends saw the portable, adjustable
frame she had created, they wanted one too.
<br /><br />
Seeing her friends’ interest in her new frame, Laurel named it the “Handi Quilter” and set out to
see if there was a market for it. She worked with several suppliers, produced a prototype and
took it to the International Quilt Festival in Houston in October of 2000. On the first day of the
festival, she called her fabricators and told them she had received enough orders to keep them
busy until Christmas.
            <br /><br />
By May of 2001, the business was incorporated and Laurel and her husband Roger went to quilt
shows around the country to sell and advertise the “Handi Quilter”, as well as set up wholesale
business relationships with quilt shop owners to sell the frame.
                        <br /><br />
The business continued to grow in 2002, an application was made for a patent, six competitors
entered the marketplace. Laurel reviewed the market and saw the demand for a larger sewing
machine. The only existing option was a commercial, long-arm machine which were typically too
large, heavy and expensive for home use. Laurel recognized the potential of the home machine
quilting market, if a quality product could be offered at an affordable price and fit in the home
environment.
                                    <br /><br />
She explored the possibilities of an existing sewing machine company making a mid arm
machine for her company. When none were interested, she decided to do it herself. In late 2002
and early 2003, she invested in the design and production of an entirely new line of products –
the “HQ Sixteen” quilting machine and the adjustable frames to support it. She hired her own
electronic and mechanical engineers, as well as support staff; established the manufacturing
infrastructure for the new products; and created a new distribution network that could sell and
service the machines.
                                                <br /><br />
Sales of the original portable quilting frames dropped off in 2004 due to market saturation,
although the “Handi Quilter” is still the top selling portable frame in the U.S. The “HQ Sixteen”
has become the centerpiece of Handi Quilter Company’s line of products.
                                                            <br /><br />
